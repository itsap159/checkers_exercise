# checkers_exercise

- Please find my submission of the challenge here. The implementation took around 6 hours to complete.
- The main source code is in 'my_file.py'.
- By default the code will only print, the output of the game(.i.e winner/incomplete/illegal/tie). In order to see the entire steps and process, please set the 'print_board' argument to 'True' in the 'play_game' function.

# Following is how this can be executed:

```bash
python my_file.py "filename.txt"
```
